                    Cryptography is everywhere in our everyday life. Whenever we connect to Facebook, shop on Amazon, call Lyft, our device runs a sequence of cryptographic protocols that enable for secure communication over a public network such as the Internet. In this class you will learn the concepts and the algorithms behind such cryptographic protocols. You will learn how to formally define security properties such as confidentiality and integrity of data; you will be able to formally prove that a cryptographic protocol achieves a certain security property; and you will be able to identify the cryptographic tools needed in real world protocols [such as SSL, Bitcoin]. You will also discover that cryptography has a much broader range of applications. It solves absolutely paradoxical problems such as proving knowledge of a secret without ever revealing the secret [zero knowledge proofs], or computing the output of a function without ever knowing the input of the function [secure computation] ... ... Note that in this course we do not focus on implementation, neither programming of cryptographic schemes.
