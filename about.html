<p class="lead text-center page-lead">Hello! My name is Michael Meli, the namesake of this website. My hope for this page is to give you an idea of who I am and what my interests are, whether that be academic or personal. More information of many of the things covered here can be found on the other pages of this website.</p>

# Academics
I am a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at North Carolina State University. My hope is to be able complete my MS in May 2018. I plan on completing a thesis during my program; I have been participating in an on-going research project under Dr. Michael Devetsikiotis and hope to continue this research into my graduate studies. The specific project I am working on is a solution for indoor localization using Bluetooth Low Energy. Such a project raises various topics for futher study, including the Internt of Things, data analytics, security, and privacy.

I completed my undergraduate education in May 2016 with a double B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, also at NC State. I graduated summa cum laude and valedictorian with a GPA of 4.0. In the process of completing my degree, I was the recipient of two distinguished scholarships. For my junior year, I received the Dewey Carr Ogburn Memorial Scholarship, awarded by the NC State ECE department to a single student each year. In my senior year, I received the Willian E. and Carol L. Highfill Scholarship in Engineering from the College of Engineering. I was also a member of the Engineering Council in my freshman and sophomore years.

# Professional
I've had the opportunity to have some great professional experiences.

During the summer of 2014, I interned at a small, local company called Mi-Corporation. Here, I worked as a software development intern, developing applications in multiple .NET languages and doing some web development and scripting in JavaScript.

In the summers of 2015 and 2016, I worked as an intern at Cisco in their Security and Trust Organization, specifically on the Hardware and Firmware Security Team. The primary IP I worked on was the Cisco Secure Boot offering. In 2015, I developed a process to enable obfuscation/encryption of compiled code in FPGA block RAM. In 2016, I developed a process to enable the use of X.509 certificates to establish trust in public key storage.

What experiences lie ahead?

#Personal
Outside of school and work, I'm an avid hockey fan. I've been a season ticket holder for the Carolina Hurricanes for over a decade, and I have played hockey competitively even longer. One of the great things about hockey is that it is an easy sport to continue playing into adulthood; I still play on a weekly basis in a local league.

In recent years, I've also fallen in love with mountain biking. One of the perks of working at Cisco is that they have a mountain bike trail on their campus. It's great to be able to go out for a ride during lunch or after work!</p>

I'm also a big tech enthusiast, although I doubt that is unique among people in this field. I may spend a little too much money keeping my custom-built desktop up to date and complementing it with the latest monitors and speakers...</p>

Of course, I love programming in my free time as well. I frequently tinker with all the standard hobbyist devices, such as Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, etc. I try to put all of my projects on my GitHub page (see the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page), so check that out for some of my work. I also describe many of them in-depth in the <a href="/experience">Experience</a> page.
