Hey everyone! Welcome to my blog! It's a bit bare right now, but I plan to add lots of interesting information in the coming days.

Be on the lookout for:

* Programming WS2812 LEDs using an TI MSP430
* Creating word clouds from Facebook comments
* Using an Arduino and AD5933 to measure impedance
* And much more!

I will also be redesigning the appearance of the blog because, as you can tell, it looks like I copy and pasted from the docs.
