<p class="lead text-center page-lead">I've had a diverse and interesting range of experience throughout my career so far. Of course, this experience not only includes my professional experience in the form of internships, but also my academic research experience undergone while studying at NC State.

                <h2>Security Software Engineering Intern</h2>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Cisco Systems</h3>
                <h4>Summer 2016</h4>
                <p>I am currently working in Cisco's Security and Trust Organization as a security software engineering intern. Specifically, I am working on the Hardware and Firmware Security team in the Trustworthy Systems group. One of the IP offerings of this team is a Secure Boot system that allows for trustworthy boot of an operating system, hypervisor, etc. on any hardware system.</p>
                <p>My initial project is to enable X.509 certificate support for this offering. Secure Boot uses a variety of public keys for verifying cryptographic hashes; however, these keys can only be stored in a Cisco proprietary format. It would be very advantageous to be able to move to the X.509 certificate standard for storing and signing public keys. Such a task involves creating and integrating a custom, light-weight ASN.1 decoder and X.509 parser into the existing microloader; using existing open-source solutions is not feasible due to size constraints of the microloader. This development is primarily done in C, with a very minor amount of assembly included.</p>

                <h2>Security Software/Hardware Engineering Intern</h2>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Cisco Systems</h3>
                <h4>Summer 2015</h4>
                <p>I previously worked in Cisco's Security and Trust Organization as a security software/hardware engineering intern. Specifically, I am working on the Hardware and Firmware Security team in the Trustworthy Systems group. One of the IP offerings of this team is a Secure Boot system that allows for trustworthy boot of an operating system, hypervisor, etc. on any hardware system.</p>
                <p>My project during this summer was to enable support for microloader obfuscation. The microloader is a small program that performs verification of the system bootloader. This program is stored on an FPGA in block RAM (BRAM). If an attacker were able to reverse engineer the FPGA (very difficult), they would be able to analyze or change this code easily, allowing them to bypass Secure Boot. By obfuscating this code with a simple encryption algorithm, the threat of this attack if heavily mitigated. Full-scale encryption such as AES or RSA cannot be used in this case due to timing constraints; each instruction must be decrypted within a single CPU clock cycle.</p>
                <p>This project involved a lot of digital hardware engineering with an FPGA using Verilog HDL, plus a significant amount of software engineering to develop build tools in C and Python to perform the initial encryption of memory and load it into the FPGA image.</p>

                <h2>Software Engineering Intern</h2>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Mi-Corporation</h3>
                <h4>Summer 2014</h4>
                <p>Mi-Corporation is the market-leader for enterprise mobile information software solutions. While I worked at Mi-Co, their major product was Mi-Forms Mobile Forms, which is a paper-like mobile form software used to digitize paper forms and enhance productivity. During this summer, I worked as a software engineering intern, primarily doing development on the Mi-Forms platform and providing services via form development and programming.</p>
                <p>Much of my time was spent on the development team. As this consisted only of the two senior engineers plus myself, I was given a large amount of responsibility to design, develop, test, and release new software features. Development was done in .NET (C# and VB.NET) or JavaScript.</p>
                <p>I also spent a significant amount of time on the services team. Here, I collaborated directly with customers to develop custom enterprise mobile data capture solutions. Mi-Co mobile forms can be extremely powerful due their ability to be programmed with VB.NET or JavaScript, which is with what I spent most of my time. I developed with Windows, iOS, and Android tablet devices.</p>
                <p>My work at Mi-Co was highly recognized. I went on multiple trips to meet with customers on-site to present my developed products. In addition, I was deployed as an local resource and company representative for a major customer in London, England for a month. The customer, Transport for London, who runs the entire London public transportation system, gave me great praise for my work while on assignment. More information on this engagement can be found <a href="http://www.mi-corporation.com/news-and-events/transport-for-london-purchases-enterprise-wide-mobile-forms-license-following-successful-phase-1-project/">on the Mi-Co website as a press release</a>.</p>
