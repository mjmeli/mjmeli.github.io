<p class="lead text-center project-page-lead">knowURshower is a project that came out of a weekend-long Make-A-Thon (hackathon) at NC State University. The Make-A-Thon was sustainability themed and so our team was tasked with devising a product that would help with water sustainability on campus. Our solution was a FitBit-like device that allows residents of dorms to easily and intuitively track their water usage and compete with friends.</p>
