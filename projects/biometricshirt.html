<h1 class="text-center" style="margin-top: 0px">Biometric Hydration Shirt</h1>
<p class="lead text-center project-page-lead">The Biometric Hydration Shirt was my project for NC State's Electrical and Computer Engineering Senior Design. The IoT wearable health-monitoring market is booming, yet there is not a single product on the market that is able to measure body hydration levels. Since hydration is such an important aspect of health for athletes, our solution was to prototype a compression shirt that can detect body hydration trends.</p>
